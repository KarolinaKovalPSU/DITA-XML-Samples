            bringing together quantities, resulting in a greater value. This operation is
            foundational for various mathematical tasks, including calculating totals and combining
            amounts.</p>
        <p>By mastering addition, you can effectively navigate numerical operations and improve your
            calculation efficiency within the app.</p>
