        <p class="p">To perform addition using the JPS Calculator app, it is crucial to grasp the concept of
            addition. Addition is a mathematical operation that combines two or more numbers to
            yield a total or sum.</p>
        <p class="p">In the app, addition is represented by the plus (+) button. When you add numbers, you are
            bringing together quantities, resulting in a greater value. This operation is
            foundational for various mathematical tasks, including calculating totals and combining
            amounts.</p>
        <p class="p">By mastering addition, you can effectively navigate numerical operations and improve your
            calculation efficiency within the app.</p>
