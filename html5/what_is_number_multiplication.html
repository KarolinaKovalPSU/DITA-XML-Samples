        <p class="p">To perform multiplication using the JPS Calculator app, it is important to understand the
            concept of multiplication. Multiplication is a mathematical operation that calculates
            the total of one number added to itself a specified number of times.</p>
        <p class="p">In the app, multiplication is represented by the multiply (Ã—) button. When you multiply
            two numbers, you are essentially scaling one number by the other, resulting in a larger
            value. This operation is fundamental for calculating areas, scaling quantities, and
            more.</p>
        <p class="p">By mastering multiplication, you can efficiently manage numerical operations and enhance
            your problem-solving skills within the app.</p>
