        <p class="p">To perform division using the JPS Calculator app, it is essential to understand the
            concept of division. Division is a mathematical operation that separates a number into
            equal parts, determining how many times one number is contained within another.</p>
        <p class="p">In the app, division is represented by the divide (รท) button. When you divide two
            numbers, you are distributing the first number into equal portions based on the second
            number, resulting in a quotient. This operation is key for tasks such as determining
            rates, averages, and more.</p>
        <p class="p">By mastering division, you can proficiently handle numerical operations and enhance your
            analytical capabilities within the app.</p>
