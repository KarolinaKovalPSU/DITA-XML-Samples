        <p class="p">To perform subtraction using the JPS Calculator app, it is essential to understand the
            concept of subtraction. Subtraction is a mathematical operation that allows you to find
            the difference between two numbers.</p>
        <p class="p">In the app, the subtraction operation is represented by the minus (-) button. When you
            subtract, you take one number away from another, resulting in a smaller number. This
            process is often described as reducing a value.</p>
        <p class="p">By mastering subtraction, you can effectively calculate differences and manage numerical
            operations within the app.</p>
